In addition, discuss with your mentor a strategy to read documentation more efficiently. This is a critically important skill to develop as software developer, as technologies keep evolving.

A: I found it interesting how props can be used. they give components parameters
and return a display by using render(). I also thought it was interesting how
React can be used to create html elements like divisions and lists. I also learned
the importance of components in react. they are objects that can take in types and statuses.

2) Referring to the official documentation, build another simple React component from scratch similar to the one we built. Discuss your experience building the component from scratch with your mentor.
